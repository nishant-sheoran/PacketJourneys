# Network Design and Implementation for State Bank of India (SBI) üè¶

## Overview
State Bank of India (SBI) is a leading financial institution in India. This project focuses on designing and implementing a secure, scalable, and high-performance network infrastructure for SBI‚Äôs headquarters and server-side site using Cisco Packet Tracer. The design adheres to the company's requirements for reliability, redundancy, scalability, and secure communication.

## Objectives
The project aims to:
- Develop a **hierarchical network design** for SBI headquarters and server-side sites.
- Ensure **redundancy** and **load balancing** by subscribing to two ISPs.
- Implement **secure communication** using Access Control Lists (ACLs), Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and encrypted access protocols.
- Configure a network that ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of data.
- Incorporate **VoIP services**, VLAN segmentation, DHCP, and inter-VLAN routing.

## Technologies Implemented

### Networking Design
1. **Hierarchical Design**: Redundant core, distribution, and access layers.
2. **Redundancy**: Dual ISP connectivity with two independent ISPs.
3. **Device Integration**:
   - Core: Cisco Catalyst 2911 routers.
   - Distribution: Two multilayer switches.
   - Access: Six access switches for departments.

### Configurations
1. **Basic Device Settings**:
   - Hostnames, console passwords, encrypted passwords.
   - Banner messages and IP domain lookup disabled.
2. **VLAN Configuration**:
   - Separate VLANs for data and voice traffic.
   - Departments segregated into unique VLANs.
3. **Subnetting and IP Addressing**:
   - Dynamic IPs for devices using DHCP.
   - Static IPs for server-side devices.
4. **Routing Protocol**: OSPF for efficient and scalable route advertising.
5. **Security Features**:
   - SSH for remote access.
   - ACLs for VTY access and NAT.
   - Port security with sticky MAC and shutdown on violations.
6. **NAT Configuration**:
   - PAT using outbound router interfaces.
   - ACL to restrict PAT access.
7. **VoIP Services**:
   - Configured using Cisco 2811 VoIP router.
   - Dial numbers in the 4XX format.
8. **IPsec VPN**:
   - Site-to-site VPN between HQ and server-side routers.
   - ACLs for VPN traffic.
9. **Wireless Networks**: WiFi APs for all departments.

## How to Use the Project
1. Open the project file `CNN PROJECT hq.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review the network topology, device configurations, and IP addressing.
3. Simulate communication using commands like `ping`, `traceroute`, and VoIP calls.
4. Modify configurations to explore different scenarios and test network resilience.

---

## Testing and Verification
1. Verify **inter-VLAN communication** using multilayer switches.
2. Test **dynamic IP allocation** using DHCP.
3. Check **secure remote access** using SSH.
4. Simulate **VoIP calls** and ensure connectivity.
5. Test **redundancy** by simulating ISP or device failures.
6. Validate **site-to-site communication** using IPsec VPN.
7. Confirm **network performance** meets company expectations.
